# Create list of numbers from 0 to 10 but with a random order (import random - see random module and usage)
# Go through the list and on every iteration as a user to guess a number between 0 and 10
# At end the program needs to print how many times the user had correct and incorrect guesses
# random_numbers = [5, 1, 3, 9, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8]
# program: Guess a number between 0 and 10.
# (If we look at the above list the current number is 5) user: 8
# program: That is not a correct number. Try to guess a new number between 0 and 10.
# (If we look at the above list the next number is 1) user: 1
# program: Bravo! That is the correct number. Try to guess a new one.
# The program continues until the end of the list...
# program: Congratulations. You've guessed the correct number 3 times and 7 times you were not correct.
