# THIRD TASK - return of the enigma :)
# Enigma is a machine used to encrypt messages -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine
# Write a program that asks the user to type some text and then encrypt that message and print it out
# Encryption is the process of converting plain text into some unreadable text e.g. text good day turn to -> whkyi knq
# Our encryption algorithm will be as follows:
# We have the alphabet -> a, b, c, h, ć, d, dž, đ, e, etc. -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0ablon:Srpskohrvatska_abeceda
# Each letter from the user's text should be 'moved' 4 places forward in the alphabet
# So will e.g. a will become ć, while b will become d, etc.
# This way we will encrypt the message and it will become unreadable

# You all remember this task and now we will do it again :)
# However, this time the solution should be as readable as possible (more readable and with fewer lines of code)
# The point is to take advantage of all the things you’ve learned so far
# Take a look at your previous solution and think about how you can improve it with the features we learned in previous weeks


### example ###
# program: Enter a word or a text and I will encrypt that text for you
# user: baba
# program: Your encrypted message is djdc

# # previous solution
# import string
#
# list_alphabet = list(string.ascii_lowercase)
# input_word = input('Enter a word or a text and I will encrypt that text for you\n')
# index_word = [list_alphabet.index(x) for x in input_word]
#
#
# index_encrypted = []
# encrypted_list = []
#
#
# for x in index_word:
#     if x > 21:
#         x -= 20
#     else:
#         x += 4
#     index_encrypted.append(x)
#     encrypted_list.append(list_alphabet[x])
#
# encrypted_string = ' '.join(encrypted_list)
#
# print('Your encrypted message is {}'.format(encrypted_string))
